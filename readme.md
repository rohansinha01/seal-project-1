## Description of Project

A paragraph discussing the idea of your project, the API you are using and desired user experience.

> I am creating a perfume maker, we generate list of perfume ingredients using the items from the perfume ingredient api. Users will select ingredients and generate an imaginary perfume.

## Details about the API

Give me a brief description of the API you are using and how you plan on using it. Does it use some sort of authentification like an APIkey. List some of the URLs you are using below.

```js
const url = "h
fetch('')


```

The Data I get back:
